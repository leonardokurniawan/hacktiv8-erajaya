        Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time playing
        guitar, watching movies, playing game. I am an intermediate acoustic
        guitarist, I like playing Depapepe songs and enjoy duet with others if
        possible. For Movies, i like watching anime or fantasy sci-fi genre
        movies.

        I also like Role playing game like World of warcraft, where a lot people
        from other country playing together with diverse languages. and i spend
        my time exploring more about latest technology via Daily Dev or Clever
        Programmer in Youtube.
